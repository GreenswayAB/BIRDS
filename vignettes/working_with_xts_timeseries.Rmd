## xts Objects
One of the objects that comes out of the `summariseBirds()` function is `$temporal`, 
a `xts` object. A `xts` is a time series (a series of data points in chronological 
order, where time is the independent variable). The ‘x’ in xts stands for extensible,
because it is an extension of `zoo` (another package). An `xts` object is formed 
just as a `zoo` object is. However, an `xts` object is in matrix form and thus 
is easier to subset through.

If we start from the basic example
```{r checkProj2, echo=FALSE}
projVer <- sf::sf_extSoftVersion()["PROJ"]
doNextChunk <- as.logical(compareVersion("5.1.0", projVer) == -1)
```

```{r SB, eval = doNextChunk, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(BIRDS)
library(xts)
# Create a grid for your sample area that will be used to summarise the data:
grid <- makeGrid(gotaland, gridSize = 10)
# The grid can be easily created in different ways. 
# Import the species observation data:
PBD <- bombusObs
# alternatively, you could load a previously downloaded .CSV file 
# PBD <- read.csv(file="path/to/your/file.csv)

# Convert the data from an observation-based to a visit-based format, 
# adding a unique identifier for each visit:
OB <- organizeBirds(PBD, sppCol = "scientificName")

# Summarise the data:
SB <- summariseBirds(OB, grid = grid)
```  

we see that SB contains an element called `SB$temporal` that contains a daily 
time series with time specific rows when there is information. `xts` also supports
time, but dating below day resolution is not yet implemented in the `BIRDS` package.  

```{r head, eval = doNextChunk}
sb.xts <- SB$temporal
head(sb.xts)
dim(sb.xts)
```


Sub-setting is convenient in `xts` as you can do it with its dates and with a 
`/` for a range of dates.  

```{r subsetting, eval = doNextChunk, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sb.xts["2017-09"] #a specific month
sb.xts["2017-09-07"] #a specific day
sb.xts["2017-01-01/2017-05-01"] #for a period
```

`xts` has several tools for converting to different periods. Here we will use 
`to.monthly`. This provides, the first, min, max, and last of the data. We can 
plot the daily maximum number of observations. The plot command with an `xts` 
object provides a TON of features. This makes it fairly easy to customize your 
plots. Read more in `?plot.xts`.  

```{r monthly and plot, eval = doNextChunk, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=9, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
obs.m <- to.monthly(sb.xts$nObs) 
obs.m["2017-04"]
sb.xts["2017-04"]

plot(obs.m["2010/2017",2], col = "darkblue", grid.ticks.on = "month",   
     major.ticks = "month", grid.col = "lightgrey",  
     main = "Maximum number of daily observations per month")
```

Only months with data are plotted in this figure. What if we want to complete 
the time series and plot all zeros too? In the original time series there is not
data for every day, therefore the time series is incomplete. 

```{r completting, eval = doNextChunk, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# sb.xts.na is same as sb.xts but with all missing days added (with NAs)
rng <- range(time(sb.xts))
sb.xts.na <- merge(sb.xts, xts(, seq(rng[1], rng[2], by = "day")))
```
However, in our monthly example we may not need data for every day, but month, 
and this time we need 0s instead of NAs. Even more, we don't want to add zeros 
for the months we already have data, because that will change the summary 
statistics. Then we add 0s for the months we have no data.

```{r completting2, eval = doNextChunk, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=9, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
z.seq <- seq(rng[1], rng[2], by = "month")
YM.sb.xts <- unique(as.Date(as.yearmon(index(sb.xts))))
YM.z.seq <- as.Date(as.yearmon(z.seq))
wTrm <- which(YM.z.seq %in% YM.sb.xts)
z.seq <- z.seq[-wTrm] ## remove the days for which 

z <- xts(, z.seq)

sb.xts.0 <- merge(sb.xts, z, fill = 0)

obs.m.0 <- to.monthly(sb.xts.0$nObs)
plot(obs.m.0["2010/2017",2], col = "darkblue", grid.ticks.on = "month",   
     major.ticks = "month", grid.col = "lightgrey", 
     main = "Maximum number of daily observations per month")
```
