Description: It helps making the evaluation and preparation of biodiversity data
   easy, systematic and reproducible. It also helps the users to overlay the 
   point observations into a custom grid that is useful for further analysis. 
   The review summarise statistics that helps evaluate whether a set of species 
   observations is fit-for-use and take decisions upon its use of on further 
   analyses. It does so by quantifying the sampling effort (amount of effort
   expended during an event) and data completeness (data gaps) to help judge 
   whether the data is representative, valid and fit for any intended purpose. 
   The 'BIRDS' package is most useful when working with heterogeneous data sets 
   with variation in the sampling process, i.e. where data have been collected 
   and reported in various ways and therefore varying in sampling effort 
   and data completeness (i.e. how well the reported observations describe the 
   true state). Primary biodiversity data (PBD) combining data from different 
   data sets, like e.g. Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) mediated
   data, commonly vary in the ways data has been generated - containing 
   opportunistically collected presence-only data together with and data from 
   systematic monitoring programs. The set of tools provided is aimed at 
   understanding the process that generated the data (i.e. observing, recording 
   and reporting species into databases). References:
